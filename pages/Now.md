# Next
In October, I will be going to New York for a week. I'm really excited for it as I have never been before! I'll be checking out a few museums, exhibitions, the Travis Scott concert and meeting a few people. I'm definitely an Americanophile (is that a word?) so I am sure the trip will be super inspiring.

I really intend to do no work on that trip. But when not in NY, I hope to have made meaningful progress on my self-study of data infrastructure. I am using Martin Kleppmann's [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) as a study guide after hearing so many good things about it. Additionally, I am hoping to have finished an essay on Media Mix Modelling (MMM). I've been meaning to for a while given how much misunderstanding there is around the limits of their applications.
