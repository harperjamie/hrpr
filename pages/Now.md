Jamie Harper is a maker, product and type designer, and design mentor currently living in Bangalore, India. With over twelve years of experience in designing type, product, brand, and strategies, he uses design to solve problems integrating user needs, requirements of business success, and the possibilities of technology.



Hiran's design and tech career started in 2006 while playing a leadership role in reimagining and reactivating [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing](https://smc.org.in/ "Swathanthra Malayalam Computing") .

A year later, he participated in the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/2007) designing the first Decorative Unicode Malayalam typeface.

In the first four years of his career, he envisioned and christened Saltmangotree, one of the first Indian digital marketing agencies and led the technology and design teams until acquisition by a French MNC. Since then, he is working as a Product Designer on tech products related to civic engagement, content publishing, and communication.

In October, I will be going to New York for a week. I'm really excited for it as I have never been before! I'll be checking out a few museums, exhibitions, the Travis Scott concert and meeting a few people. I'm definitely an Americanophile (is that a word?) so I am sure the trip will be super inspiring.

I really intend to do no work on that trip. But when not in NY, I hope to have made meaningful progress on my self-study of data infrastructure. I am using Martin Kleppmann's Designing Data-Intensive Applications as a study guide after hearing so many good things about it. Additionally, I am hoping to have finished an essay on Media Mix Modelling.
