Classic David Fincher, but also very self-aware and almost a parody of his earlier work. 

I was struck by the mantras the namesake Killer kept repeating to himself throughout the film; 'trust no one', 'anticipate, don't improvise' etc. On the one hand, totally cliche and used for humorous effect when he makes a mistake. On the other hand, he does sort of believe in these principles and he is, despite his mistakes, on some level quite competent. No one wants a neurotic assassin and I think the self delusion works for him.

I was also struck by how unimpressive the venture capitalist that had been organising the hits was in person, and how easy it was to break into his apartment using products available on Amazon. The future that we inhabit is really quite banal.
